# 如何思考
读论文时应该有的思考方向
When reading a paper, please try to answer these questions (using 1-3 sentences).

• What is the problem? / How important is it? 
• What are the insights? (something like principle; what are the intuitions; why is it possible to carry out the design of this method) 
• What is the solution? / Is it feasible? (is the understanding approach appropriate; why this understanding approach is used; and is there a better understanding approach; can it be improved in terms of computational volume or memory) 
• What is the takeaway message? (different from insights; what interesting phenomena can be observed after designing this method)
• Will this paper win the test of time award? (what does this paper really mean for the domain)
• Name one reason why this paper should have not appeared in NIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc?

• What’s New
• Key insight
• How it works
• Results 
• Why it matters
• We’re thinking


# 如何跟踪前沿


跟踪人而非具体论文,通过Google Scholar关注
 **Track the people, not the papers**
 
There are far fewer key people who are driving the field forward than the number of papers. Check out who the authors are when you read papers. Overtime you will recognize the important ones.

Use Google Scholar to follow most frequently authors. Today almost everyone has an (automatic) profile. Also, follow the key publications.


阅读论文的参考文献
**Read papers with good related work**

A good related work section saves you so much time by providing a clear, organized view for prior work.

Side note: Please save others' time by writing a good related work


归纳整理（表格）相近的文献
 **Organize the papers**

Don't read papers individually. Think about how are they related (similar in some aspects, but different in others). It often helps to build a table with columns specifying ATTRIBUTES.

With this table, reading new papers becomes easy (just add more rows).


理解要点是最重要的，因此可以多看摘要，talk和介绍视频
 **Avoid reading the paper**
 
Instead of spending time reading the actual paper, find resources that are much easier to digest, e.g., a talk, a youtube video, teaser results, introductory video, or an overview figure.

Very often understanding the gist of the paper is all you need.

带着目的阅读
 **Read with a purpose**
 
Before investing time on reading a paper, think about WHY you are reading it. Are you reading for the experimental setup, the organization, the story, the style, the method, or the visualization?

You almost never need to read a paper from top to bottom.


分析趋势
**Identify the trend**

Use your favorite tools to find what's hot/trendy, e.g.,
- [http://arxiv-sanity.com](http://arxiv-sanity.com/)
- [https://paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/)
- [https://twitter.com](https://twitter.com/)

使用高亮插件来加快文献搜索速度
**use multi-keyword highlighter addon**

 To reduce your time searching for publications in conferences/journals use multi-keyword highlighter addon (for e.g., [https://is.gd/2lNdE1](https://is.gd/2lNdE1)) and add multiple keywords related to your literature review (e.g., educational technologies, emotional labor, emotional regulation).

先读综述文献
 **Try to cover those papers that are sweeping surveys**
 
 Try to cover those papers that are sweeping surveys (not quant surveys, but broad review papers on the topic; for eg., [https://is.gd/39lleZ](https://is.gd/39lleZ)). They give you birds-eye view of the topic/field. It is especially useful, if you are looking outside your field.
 

读完论文及时做一个小总结
**write a small summary**

Don't start literature review at the last moment. Keep dumping the papers into a folder or a note. When you have free time, just give it a brief read and write a small summary of 50-100 words. This summary should only talk about how the paper is useful for your study.
