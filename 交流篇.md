# 使用先进工具
Mastering the following **two key tools** :
- Git and GitHub
    - Git and Github will be our main collaboration platforms, thanks to their advances in version control.
    - Some tutorials:
        - [Git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
        - [A Tutorial for Git and GitHub](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:ff780599-d5e2-4d05-b923-1c333cbf2842/A%20Tutorial%20for%20GitHub.pdf)
        - [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
        - Advanced: [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/zh)
        - [Git commit message template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git-commit-message)
- Latex
    - Please always try to use latex as the primary communication tool/format (with Github), instead of Word and PPT.
    - You can find some given [templates](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/tree/main/lab_templates). Please consider using them, e.g., [math notations](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/blob/main/lab_templates/latex_paper_submission/neurips2022/configuration/lins_macros.tex), and [algorithm templates](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/blob/main/lab_templates/latex_paper_submission/neurips2022/configuration/lins_algo.tex).
    - Some tutorials:
        - [Overleaf Tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials)
        - [LaTeXPrimer](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/)

# 周会与日常汇报
每周会议与日常汇报


 • Setting up a weekly meeting with your mentors is great.
 
 • Send frequent and concise updates along the way.

保持独立但积极寻求帮助


• (precondition) Please first try to be independent!!! 


• BUT, If you spend 15 mins googling and still don’t know where to start,


• please reach out to your peers/mentors


• Asking for help is not a sign of weakness.

会议前先发结果让导师吸收，会议中保留十分钟讨论未来规划，会议后总结会议并设置未来计划
• Before (at least 30 min): send results/agenda whenever they are available. Give your mentors time to digest them.
• In the meeting: progress update. Reserve the last 10 mins to discuss the next steps. 
• After: Send a summary and an actionable plan to keep everyone on the same page.


如果没进展不要急着取消计划，可以重点讨论遇到的问题
~~When you make less progress or get stuck somewhere, it feels right to cancel the meeting as you have nothing to report.~~ 
• NO! 
• That’s a TERRIBLE idea!
• Discuss the problems with your mentors/collaborators
• Help them help you get unstuck

导师不会知道最新的技术和细节，导师也会非常健忘，像对待老奶奶一样讲解，像对待金鱼一样提供前情提要
Facts:
• Your mentors are not going to know all the latest and greatest papers/tools/tricks nor the low-level details.
• Your advisor will forget everything you discuss the moment you step out the door. 
Suggestions: 
• Treat your advisor as goldfish. Always provide high-level contexts first. 
• Just like talking to your grandparents, distill your work to its essence so that they can easily understand.
• Maintain meeting minutes that everyone agrees upon so you have consistent guidance.

每一时间段只开启一个话题，汇报要结构清晰，善用斜体黑体分段
• One topic at a time 
	• ✗Here are the results of the experiments we discussed. BTW, can you approve my conference travel expense?
	 • ✓Conference travel expense - Approval required by April 20.
• Formatting 
	• ✗Writing loooong free-form paragraphs. 
	• ✓Writing structured, concise, clear texts. Formatting tools (bold, underscore, italic, itemize, enumerate, paragraph, line breaks) are your friends.


在同步会议前异步实时分享进度，同步会议后指定可执行的下一步计划（可执行的指的是 谁 在什么时候 做什么），会议的制定要有具体的时间。询请会议时间时要给出自己合适的时间，来给对方做参考

• Async sharing before sync meeting 
	• ✗Describe your work and show results during the meeting.
	 • ✓Summarize your work/results and send them for early feedback before the meeting. Make the best use of your favorite collaborative document platforms (GitHub in our case). 
 • Actionable next steps after a sync meeting 
	 • ✗Just talked. Brainstormed multiple ideas. Created a bunch of tasks. • ✓Decide WHO to do WHAT by WHEN. 
 • Give others control when setting up meetings 
	 • ✗When will you be available next week? 
	 • ✓I am available in the following time slots. When will work best for you? Use calendar tools (calendly, google calendar) to avoid back-and-forth discussions. 
 • Agenda, agenda, agenda 
	 • ✗Let’s hop on a call and chat next week. 
	 • ✓Send clear meeting agenda with allocated time.


# 实验展示

把导师当作金鱼与老奶奶，说明为什么要做这个实验
• Plz treat your mentors as goldfishes.
• Remind them WHY you did a particular experiment or implement a particular thing.
• This will provide the context for them to help interpret the results and steer the direction of your research.

介绍实验预期和实验的具体失败
• Before showing your results
• comment on what should have happened (if everything is correct)?
• Show the (failed) results. 
• Don’t just say “It doesn’t work.”
• Describe HOW it fails (with details and ideally in a self-contained manner).

对实验结果给出自己的理解（机理性的科研就来源于这些思考）
After showing your results, comment on how the results align with or deviate from your expectations.
• Describe the detailed process you went through, the reasoning you, the methodology you adopt, and the interpretations of the results you got. 
• Say something like 
	• I’ve narrowed down the problem to step B.
	• Until step A, you can see that it works, because you put in X and you get Y out, as we expect.
	• You can see how it fails here at B.
	• I’ve ruled out W and Z as the cause.
• or
	• Here is HOW it fails.
	• I feed X but somehow did not get Y.
	• I believe the core issues lie in steps Z and W.
	• I have ruled out W as the cause.
	• Next, I will design experiments to isolate the step Z.

可视化展示
Seeing the results with a good visualization helps
	• deepen our understanding 
	• spot the issues


前瞻性地提出下一步的计划，计划做X因为Y
• Remember to proactively propose the next steps so that we can make progress on the project. 
• But 
	• DON’t: “Any feedback on the next steps?” 
	• DO: “I plan to do X and then Y because of Z.” 
• Remember that you are the main DRIVER of the project. Don’t just wait for instructions.
• This is a MUCH better way to solicit feedback b/c 
	• your mentor will have sth. concrete to work on and
	• you get to understand why specific feedback was given
