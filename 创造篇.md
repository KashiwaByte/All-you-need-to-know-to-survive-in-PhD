# 如何想个好点子

找一个不同的维度

**Find a different dimension**

Just learn a cool idea from others? Think about how you could extend it to another dimension.

Ex: Text / audio / image / video / graph

降低现有假设的约束

**Relax assumptions**

Identify the underlying assumptions of existing work and try relaxing them to make it work in more unconstrained settings.

给已有观点加上形容词

**Add an adjective**

Given an existing idea X, add an adjective to make it

- slow -> fast
- batch -> online
- sensitive -> robust
- centralized -> distributed
- single-step -> progressive
- single-level -> hierarchical
- fixed -> adaptive, sth-aware
- data-hungry -> data-efficient and so on


给 SOTA 上压力测试，找到它的不足

**Stress test the state-of-the-art**

Don't simply run on the fixed, boring benchmark datasets. Try it out on diverse, unconstrained examples and see how it fails. It's a great way to identify limitations of existing work. This is where your work can fill the gap.
